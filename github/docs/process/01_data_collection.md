# Data Collection
Before any programming can begin, we need to collect data about the airports and aircraft types. Then, using the collected data, derive:

1. The distances between each pair of airports
2. The demand for each flight
3. The amount of fuel consumed by each aircraft for each flight
4. The cost of a ticket for each flight for each aircraft

Given the variable nature of the source data, the derived data should be generated by a Python 
script from the base scripts `airports.csv` or `aircraft.csv` and aggregated in the script 
`flights.csv`. Data generated should be modular, have minimal dependencies, and be in CSV format.
 All data collected or generated must be done individually by two different group members and
 reviewed by a third member.
