Date: 1.15.2024
ID: CA-001
Severity: Moderate
Priority: Medium
Description: Shortest path algorithm used to determine flight routes not reliably using the
             true shortest paths.
Steps to reproduce: 1. Run shortest path algorithm on airports.
                    2. Calculate distances by hand.
                    3. Algorithm output distances do not align with manual calculations.
Assigned to: Zach Christopher

Status: Completed (1.17.2024)
Comments: Algorithm logic was not correct.

Date: 1.23.2024
ID: CA-002
Severity: Severe
Priority: High
Description: Script to calculate flight demand is wildly inflated.
Steps to reproduce: 1. Run script to calculate flight demand.
                    2. Perform flight demand calculations by hand.
                    3. Observe difference in script output and manual calculations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2.1.2024
ID: CA-003
Severity: Severe
Priority: High
Description: Scripts (flight_demand.csv, flight_fuel_capacity.csv, and flight_profit_loss.csv) 
             calculate inaccurate data.
Steps to reproduce: 1. Run scripts.
                    2. Run calculations manually.
                    3. Observe difference.
Assigned to: Parker Blue

Status: Completed (2.6.2024)

          flight_profit_loss.csv to weighted distance. Added percent full for possible number of 
          plane per day.
